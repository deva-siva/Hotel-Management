🏨 Hotel Reservation System (Java Console App)

This is a simple Java-based console application for managing hotel room reservations. It allows users to book rooms, view current bookings, and cancel existing reservations. The system simulates basic hotel reservation functionality and demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like class design, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

✨ Features:

📌 Book a Room:

  Allows users to enter guest details, room category, and check-in/check-out dates. A simulated card number input step is included for realism.

❌ Cancel Reservation:

  Users can cancel a reservation using the unique booking ID.

📋 View All Bookings:

  Displays all current bookings in a readable format.

💾 Persistent Storage:

  Bookings are saved to a text file (reservations.txt) and reloaded each time the program starts.

🧱 OOP Concepts Demonstrated:

Class & Object: Reservation details are modeled using a Reservation class.

Encapsulation: Booking data and methods are grouped in a class structure.

Polymorphism: The toString() method is overridden to format reservation data for storage and display.

Abstraction: Complex operations (like formatting data for files) are abstracted from the main program logic.

Static Members: Used to maintain a unique reservation ID and shared list of all bookings.

📂 File Structure:
HotelReservation.java – Main program logic and file I/O

Reservation class – Models a booking record.

reservations.txt – Auto-generated file to store reservations persistently.
